# Particles
CSS only background particle effect without images or javascript.

The effect is achieved by rotating three panes that contain pseudo elements with randomly position box shadows.
The demo can be easily adjusted to change the speed or number of particles and is surprisingly GPU efficient.

## Development

To run the demo you can just open the index.html file.

To modify the scss you will need to run `npm run dev`.
